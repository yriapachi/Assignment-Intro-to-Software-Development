A coffee shop needs to keep track the orders for delivery they receive by phone calls.
The coffee shop has several employees that will be using the system:
1. Clerks: Set orders and can check if there are pending orders.
2. Delivery: Update an order as completed.
3. Manager: View reports and statistics.
Each employee will have a user account to login (username/password) and the system will
identify their role and respond accordingly.

After each order placed, the clerk will enter to the system:
• The name of the customer
• Address of the customer
• Description
• Date (formatted as: DDMMYY)
• Total amount of order
An ID, auto-increment number, will be assigned by the system to the order.
The clerk will be able to bulk upload orders using preformatted files (txt or csv).
The clerk will also be able to check incomplete orders.
Upon delivery, the delivery employee will get into the system and update the order as
completed.
The manager will be able to select from the system to do the following:
• Numbers of order placed by one specific customer
• Number of orders in one specific day
• Total amount of all orders delivered
• Total amount of the orders placed by a specific customer
• Total amount of the orders placed on specific day
Also, the manager will be able to select from the system to receive the following reports:
(in .csv format)
• Names of customers
• Orders entered per user
• All data entered
• Total amount of orders per day (one record per day)
